# mediNER_CNX-Hospital

## This study investigated extracting medication information from Thai hospital records using ontology-based named-entity recognition (NER) and pre-trained transformer models. Given the narrative style of Thai medical notes, which combine Thai and English terminology, extracting accurate medication data poses challenges. An annotated dataset of 90 discharge summaries was developed following SNOMED-CT and FHIR standards. Three deep learning models—BioClinicalBERT, ClinicalBERT, and Microsoft BiomedNLP—were trained and evaluated. ClinicalBERT achieved the highest overall F1-score in entity recognition, especially for drug substances and dosage. The results show the potential of ontology-based, medication information extraction using transformer-based models for improving data standardization, and interoperability in Thai healthcare.
